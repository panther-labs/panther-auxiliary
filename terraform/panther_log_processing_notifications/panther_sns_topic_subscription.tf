# NOTE: this resource must be applied in the Panther master account, not in a satellite account,

# Subscriptions in the CloudFormation template version of this log_processing Terraform module
# are applied in the opposite manner (in satellite accounts) because Panther is configured to
# auto-confirm subscription requests originating from CloudFormation.

# Each satellite account requires its own topic subscription resource. In Terraform, this can be 
# accomplished for multiple accounts using a for_each expression.
